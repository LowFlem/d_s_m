DBRW: Dual-Binding Random Walk for
Anti-Cloning Locally/Offline
Brandon ”Cryptskii” Ramsay
May 14, 2025
Abstract—Cloning attacks represent a significant threat to
mobile applications, particularly those handling sensitive data
or financial transactions. Current anti-cloning solutions typically rely on hardware binding or environmental detection, but
not both, creating exploitable security gaps. We introduce the
Dual-Binding Random Walk (DBRW) algorithm, a novel anticloning approach that integrates hardware-derived entropy with
execution environment fingerprinting through a dual-binding
mechanism that establishes cryptographic inseparability between
physical and contextual identifiers. DBRW leverages memory
timing characteristics to extract device-specific entropy and
combines it with application environment parameters to detect both cross-device and same-device container-based cloning.
We integrate DBRW into the Decentralized State Machine
(DSM) framework and demonstrate its efficacy in preventing
state migration attacks. Experimental results show that DBRW
achieves 99.7% accuracy in detecting cloned applications while
maintaining a false positive rate below 0.5%, even in resourceconstrained mobile environments.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile application cloning has emerged as a critical security challenge, particularly for financial, cryptocurrency, and
identity-management applications. Cloning attacks typically
fall into two categories: cross-device cloning, where application state is migrated to a different physical device, and samedevice container-based cloning, where applications are duplicated within isolated environments on a single physical device.
Traditional anti-cloning solutions focus on either hardwarebased device fingerprinting or environment detection, but
rarely both.
This paper introduces the Dual-Binding Random Walk
(DBRW) algorithm, a novel approach that creates cryptographic inseparability between physical device characteristics and execution environment contexts. DBRW combines
hardware-derived entropy from memory timing characteristics
with environmental fingerprinting to create a dual binding that
detects both forms of cloning with high accuracy.
The main contributions of this paper are:
• A novel dual-binding mechanism that establishes cryptographic inseparability between hardware and environment
characteristics
• A random walk-based hardware entropy extraction
method optimized for resource-constrained mobile environments
• A forward-only commitment chain mechanism that prevents state rollback attacks
• Integration of DBRW into the Decentralized State Machine (DSM) framework
• Experimental validation demonstrating high accuracy in
detecting both cross-device and container-based cloning
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A. Device Fingerprinting
Device fingerprinting techniques aim to uniquely identify
hardware using characteristics that are difficult to replicate.
Bojinov et al. [1] demonstrated that sensor calibration data
could fingerprint mobile devices. Das et al. [2] explored using
memory access patterns for device identification. However,
these approaches focus primarily on cross-device cloning and
are ineffective against container-based attacks.
B. Environment Detection
Environment detection techniques identify virtualized or
containerized environments. Petsas et al. [3] developed methods to detect Android emulators. Colp et al. [4] presented
techniques for identifying containerized environments. These
approaches, while effective against same-device cloning, fail
to address cross-device cloning when hardware characteristics
are not considered.
C. Decentralized State Machine (DSM)
DSM is a framework for secure distributed applications that
uses state transition systems with cryptographic protections.
DSM applications maintain application state as a series of
transitions with signatures, making state migration a securitycritical operation that requires protection against unauthorized
cloning.
III. THREAT MODEL
We consider adversaries attempting two types of application
cloning:
• Cross-device cloning: Extracting application state from
one device and recreating it on a physically different
device.
• Container-based cloning: Duplicating an application
within isolated environments (containers, VMs, etc.) on
the same physical device.
We assume the adversary has full control over the target
device’s software environment, including the ability to modify
the operating system, but does not have the capability to precisely replicate hardware timing characteristics across different
physical devices.
IV. DBRW: SYSTEM DESIGN
A. Theoretical Foundation
We begin by formalizing the dual-binding problem and
establishing its theoretical properties.
Definition 1 (Hardware Entropy). Let H represent a
hardware-specific entropy function that maps a device d to
a bit string: H : D → {0, 1}
n, where D is the set of all
devices and n is the entropy length.
Definition 2 (Environment Fingerprint). Let E represent an
environment fingerprinting function that maps an execution
environment e to a bit string: E : E\⊑ → {0, 1}
m, where
E\⊑ is the set of all possible execution environments and m
is the fingerprint length.
Definition 3 (Dual-Binding). A dual-binding function B combines hardware entropy and environment fingerprints: B :
{0, 1}
n × {0, 1}
m → {0, 1}
k
, where k is the binding key
length.
Theorem 1 (Binding Inseparability). If B is constructed using
a cryptographic hash function H as B(h, e) = H(h ∥ e), then
given only B(h, e), it is computationally infeasible to find h
′
and e
′
such that B(h
′
, e′
) = B(h, e) and either h
′ ̸= h or
e
′ ̸= e.
Proof. Assume that given b = B(h, e) = H(h ∥ e), an
adversary can find h
′
and e
′
such that H(h
′ ∥ e
′
) = b and
either h
′ ̸= h or e
′ ̸= e.
This implies the adversary can find a collision for H,
contradicting the collision resistance property of cryptographic
hash functions. Therefore, it is computationally infeasible to
find such h
′
and e
′
.
Lemma 2 (Cross-Device Detection). Let devices d1 and d2 be
distinct physical devices. Then with high probability, H(d1) ̸=
H(d2) and consequently B(H(d1), e) ̸= B(H(d2), e) for any
environment e.
Proof. The hardware entropy function H extracts timing
characteristics of memory access patterns that are influenced
by physical hardware variations. These variations exist even
among devices of identical make and model due to manufacturing differences.
Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be the random variables representing
timing measurements on device d1, and let Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn be
the corresponding measurements on device d2.
Each Xi and Yi follows a distribution with device-specific
parameters. The probability that all measurements are identical
across devices is:
P(∀i : Xi = Yi) = Yn
i=1
P(Xi = Yi) (1)
Since each measurement is independent and influenced by
hardware-specific variations, P(Xi = Yi) < 1, and thus
P(∀i : Xi = Yi) ≈ 0 for sufficiently large n.
Therefore, with high probability, H(d1) ̸= H(d2), and due
to the collision resistance of B, B(H(d1), e) ̸= B(H(d2), e).
Lemma 3 (Container Detection). Let e1 and e2 be distinct
execution environments on the same device d. Then E(e1) ̸=
E(e2) and consequently B(H(d), E(e1)) ̸= B(H(d), E(e2)).
Proof. The environment fingerprinting function E captures
properties such as installation path, data directory, and storage
volume identifiers. Different execution environments (containers, VMs, etc.) will have different values for these properties
by design.
Let P1, P2, . . . , Pm be the environmental parameters captured for environment e1, and let Q1, Q2, . . . , Qm be the
corresponding parameters for environment e2.
By the definition of distinct execution environments, there
exists at least one parameter j such that Pj ̸= Qj . Therefore,
E(e1) ̸= E(e2).
Due to the collision resistance of B, it follows that
B(H(d), E(e1)) ̸= B(H(d), E(e2)).
Theorem 4 (Forward-Only Commitment). Let Ci =
H(Ci−1 ∥ K ∥ Ti ∥ Ni ∥ i) be a commitment chain, where
K is the binding key, Ti
is a timestamp, Ni
is a nonce, and i
is the chain index. Given Ci
, it is computationally infeasible
to compute Ci+1 without knowledge of K.
Proof. To compute Ci+1, one needs:
Ci+1 = H(Ci ∥ K ∥ Ti+1 ∥ Ni+1 ∥ (i + 1)) (2)
While Ci
, Ti+1, Ni+1, and (i + 1) may be known or
computable, K is the binding key derived from hardware
entropy and environment fingerprint. By Theorem 1 (Binding
Inseparability), it is computationally infeasible to determine
K without knowledge of both the hardware entropy and
environment fingerprint.
Therefore, without K, computing Ci+1 would require finding a preimage for H, which contradicts the preimage resistance property of cryptographic hash functions.
B. System Architecture
DBRW consists of four primary components:
1) RandomWalkMemoryInterrogation: Extracts
hardware-derived entropy through memory timing
measurements
2) EnvironmentFingerprinting: Collects execution environment characteristics
3) DualBindingKeyDerivation: Combines hardware entropy and environment fingerprints to create a binding
key
4) ForwardOnlyCommitmentChain: Maintains a temporal chain of commitments to prevent state rollback
Fig. 1. DBRW architecture and its integration with the DSM framework.
Figure 1 illustrates the DBRW architecture and its integration with the DSM framework.
C. Hardware Entropy Extraction
DBRW extracts hardware entropy by performing a deterministic random walk through memory and measuring access
timing characteristics. The random walk pattern is carefully
designed to be:
• Deterministic: The same sequence of memory addresses
is accessed each time
• Diverse: The access pattern covers different memory
regions
• Timing-sensitive: The measurements focus on timing
variations influenced by hardware characteristics
Algorithm 1: RandomWalkMemoryInterrogation
Initialize memory block with random data;
Generate walk addresses using deterministic seed;
Perform warm-up iterations;
for each address in walk addresses do
Flush CPU cache;
Start timer;
Perform memory access;
End timer;
Record timing difference;
end
Process timing measurements into fingerprint;
return Hardware fingerprint;
D. Environment Fingerprinting
DBRW captures environment-specific parameters that differ
across containers or virtual environments but remain constant
within the same execution context:
• Installation path hash
• Installation time
• Application data directory information
• Package name and UID combination
• Storage volume UUID
E. Dual-Binding Mechanism
The dual-binding mechanism combines hardware entropy
and environment fingerprints using an HMAC-based key
derivation function:
Algorithm 2: DualBindingKeyDerivation
Quantize hardware entropy for stability;
Use environment fingerprint as HMAC salt;
Derive binding key:
K = HMAC(salt, hardware entropy);
return Binding key;
F. Forward-Only Commitment Chain
DBRW maintains a forward-only commitment chain to
prevent state rollback attacks:
Algorithm 3: ForwardOnlyCommitmentChain
Initialize: C0 = H(K ∥ deviceInfo);
Set timestamp T0 and index i = 0;
Generate initial nonce N0;
Store C0, T0, N0, and i;
Procedure Extend(K)
i = i + 1;
Generate new timestamp Ti and nonce Ni
;
Ci = H(Ci−1 ∥ K ∥ Ti ∥ Ni ∥ i);
Store Ci
, Ti
, Ni
, and i;
return true;
end
Procedure Verify(K)
Verify current time is not earlier than stored
timestamp;
Compute verification tag using K;
Check tag against stored commitment;
return result;
end
V. IMPLEMENTATION IN DSM FRAMEWORK

C. JNI Bridge for Native Integration
To bridge between Java and native code, we implemented
a JNI connector:

D. Integration with DSM Identity Framework
DBRW is integrated with the DSM identity system to bind
hardware characteristics to cryptographic identities:

device_id.as_bytes()) {
16 Ok(hw_entropy) => combined_data.
extend_from_slice(&hw_entropy),
17 Err(_) => {
18 // Fallback to MPC blind entropy if DBRW

VI. EVALUATION
We evaluated DBRW along four dimensions: effectiveness,
performance, reliability, and security.
A. Effectiveness in Detecting Clones
We tested DBRW against both cross-device and containerbased cloning scenarios:
TABLE I
CLONE DETECTION ACCURACY
Scenario Detection Rate False Positives
Cross-Device Cloning 99.8% 0.3%
Container-Based Cloning 100% 0.2%
Combined Scenarios 99.7% 0.4%
B. Performance Impact
We measured the performance overhead of DBRW on
mobile application startup and during runtime:
TABLE II
PERFORMANCE OVERHEAD
Metric Average Overhead
Application Startup Time +142ms (5.7%)
Memory Usage +1.8MB (2.3%)
CPU Usage (Background) +0.2%
Battery Impact (Daily) +0.3%
C. Reliability Across Devices
We tested DBRW across various Android device models to
assess its reliability:
TABLE III
CROSS-DEVICE RELIABILITY
Device Category Hardware Recognition False Rejections
High-end (8+ cores) 99.9% 0.1%
Mid-range (4-8 cores) 99.7% 0.4%
Budget (¡4 cores) 98.9% 0.8%
Older Devices (5+ years) 98.2% 1.2%
D. Security Analysis
We conducted a security analysis against various attack
vectors:
TABLE IV
SECURITY ANALYSIS
Attack Vector Resistance Level
Exact Hardware Cloning High
Virtualization/Emulation Very High
Container-Based Cloning Very High
Timing Analysis Moderate
State Extraction High
State Rollback Very High
VII. DISCUSSION
A. Advantages of Dual-Binding Approach
The combination of hardware-derived entropy and environment fingerprinting provides superior protection compared to
either approach alone. Hardware binding ensures that even
perfect replication of the software environment on a different
physical device will fail validation. Environment fingerprinting
ensures that even on the same physical device, containerized
instances will be detected.
B. Error Tolerance for Hardware Variations
DBRW implements an error tolerance mechanism for hardware fingerprinting that accommodates slight variations in
timing measurements while still detecting significant changes.
This is crucial for practical deployments where minor hardware fluctuations are expected.
C. Forward-Only Commitment Chain
The commitment chain mechanism provides temporal validation that prevents state rollback attacks. This is particularly important for financial applications where the ability to
”rewind” state could enable double-spending.
D. Limitations
DBRW has several limitations that should be acknowledged:
• Performance variations: On extremely resourceconstrained devices, timing measurements may be less
reliable, necessitating more measurement iterations.
• Power management: Aggressive power management can
affect timing measurements, requiring calibration and
adjustment.
• Hardware upgrades: Major hardware component replacements may trigger false positives, requiring reinitialization.
VIII. CONCLUSION
The Dual-Binding Random Walk (DBRW) algorithm represents a significant advancement in anti-cloning protection for
mobile applications. By creating cryptographic inseparability
between hardware characteristics and execution environment
context, DBRW detects both cross-device and container-based
cloning attacks with high accuracy. Its integration with the
DSM framework enhances the security of identity management
and financial operations in distributed systems.
Future work will focus on extending DBRW to support
more diverse hardware platforms, improving its resilience
against sophisticated timing analysis attacks, and developing
techniques to distinguish between legitimate device upgrades
and cloning attempts.

Missing K
× Cannot generate C1 without K
Forward-Only Commitment Formula:
Ci = H(Ci−1 ∥ K ∥ Ti ∥ Ni ∥ i)
Security Property: Without knowledge of the binding
key K, an attacker cannot generate valid future commitment states, even with knowledge of previous commitments.
This prevents both state cloning and state rollback attacks.

Quantization Process for Stable Hardware Entropy
Memory timing measurements naturally fluctuate due to temperature, CPU load, and other factors.
To create a stable hardware entropy source, raw timing measurements are quantized into discrete bins
that preserve the device’s unique timing signature while minimizing noise-induced variations.
The device-specific pattern is maintained while reducing sensitivity to minor timing changes.
