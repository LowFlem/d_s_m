DSM (Decentralized State Machine): Core Concepts and Math
1. Identity & State: Forward-Only Hash Chain
• State Evolution:
Each identity is a straight hash chain (not a blockchain).
State updates are deterministic, forward-only (irreversible).
Formula:
S
_n = H(S_{n-1} || R_n)
• S
n: New state hash
_
• S
_{n-1}: Previous state
• R
_n: New randomness / event / transaction
• H: Cryptographic hash (Blake3, quantum-safe)
⸻
2. Sparse Indexing & SMT (Sparse Merkle Tree):
• Efficient Verification:
Every state or token update can be proved with a Merkle proof using a Sparse
Merkle Tree (SMT).
• Sparse Index:
Allows for direct, sub-linear verification—no need to traverse the whole chain.
⸻
3. Bilateral Isolation & Offline Consistency:
• Bilateral State Update:
For peer-to-peer exchange, both parties update their local straight hash chains.
States are “bilaterally isolated”: both chains progress in lockstep for the
transaction.
S
_A' = H(S_A || tx)
S
_B' = H(S_B || tx)
• No third-party or consensus needed.
• State sync can happen offline; finality is immediate.
⸻
4. Token/Balance Commitments:
• Token Commitments in State:
Token balances are embedded directly into the state update, not stored globally.
Balance Update:
B
n = B
_
_{n-1} + Δ
_
n
• Δ
_n: Net token change from tx (can be positive or negative)
• Double-Spend Prevention:
Ensured by chain structure—only one valid forward path.
Constraint:
∑_{i=0}^{n} Δ
i ≤ B
_
_
n
• No negative balance possible
⸻
5. Forward-Only Recovery (Key Compromise):
• Recovery is irreversible:
If a state is compromised, derive a new state using invalidation marker and new
randomness.
S
_{new} = H(I(S_k) || R_{new})
• I(S_k): Invalidation marker for compromised state
• Old branch is dead; chain only continues forward from new state.
⸻
6. Genesis State: Decentralized, Blind MPC
• Genesis Creation:
The first state (G) is created via threshold MPC or blind commit, ensuring no single
party controls genesis.
G = H(b1 || b2 || ... || b_t || Aux)
• b
_i: Blind inputs from t parties
• Aux: Auxiliary domain data
⸻
7. No Consensus, No Miners, No Gas:
• All validation is local and cryptographic;
no consensus protocol, no miners, no transaction fees (gas).
⸻
8. Immediate Finality, True Offline Capability:
• State transitions are final at the point of local computation.
• State can be transferred, proven, and updated entirely offline—no
dependency on internet or global network.
⸻
9. Quantum-Resistant Crypto:
• Uses post-quantum primitives:
• Hash: Blake3
• Signatures: SPHINCS+, Kyber, etc.
⸻
10. Core Security Guarantee:
• Tamper-proof: Only forward transitions are valid.
• No rollbacks, no forks, no re-orgs.
• Proof-of-Validity = Existence of correct forward hash chain and
Merkle proof.
⸻
11. Protocol Code Structure (in Pseudocode):
type State = {
prevHash: string,
randomness: string,
merkleRoot: string,
balances: Record<TokenId, number>,
// ...other fields (identity, metadata, etc.)
}
// Forward-only state transition:
function evolveState(prev: State, tx: Transaction, randomness: string): State {
const newBalances = { ...prev.balances }
// Apply token changes:
for (const {token, delta} of tx.changes) {
newBalances[token] = (newBalances[token] || 0) + delta
if (newBalances[token] < 0) throw new Error("Invalid: Negative balance")
}
// Generate next state:
return {
prevHash: hashState(prev),
randomness,
merkleRoot: updateSMT(prev.merkleRoot, tx),
balances: newBalances,
// ...
}
}
⸻
TL;DR DSM is:
• Deterministic, quantum-safe, forward-only hash chains
• Local-only, gas-free, miner-less
• Merkle proofs for instant verification
• Bilateral isolation for offline, trustless P2P
• Finality is immediate; all security is math, not voting
⸻
⸻
DSM vs. CAP Theorem — Production Reference
⸻
1. CAP Theorem (Classical Formulation)
CAP: No distributed system can simultaneously guarantee:
• Consistency (C): Every read returns the most recent write or an error.
• Availability (A): Every request receives a (non-error) response.
• Partition Tolerance (P): The system continues despite arbitrary
network splits.
Formal Statement:
\not\exists S: C(S) \land A(S) \land P(S)
• Assumes monolithic global state, uniform consistency, tightly coupled
nodes.
⸻
2. DSM’s Rejection of CAP Assumptions
A. No Global State Synchronization
• DSM defines per-relationship states:
\mathcal{G}{DSM} = \{ R{i,j} \mid i \neq j \}
• Consistency is local:
Consistent(R_{i,j}) \iff \forall (S^i_m, S^j_p) \in R_{i,j}, \quad Verify(S^i_m, S^j_p)
= \text{true}
B. Heterogeneous Consistency
• Each relationship (pair) can have unique consistency rules:
ConsistencyDomain(R_{i,j}) \cap ConsistencyDomain(R_{k,l}) = \emptyset \quad
\forall (i,j) \neq (k,l)
• No global consensus dependency.
C. No Global Atomicity
• Each operation only affects its relationship:
Execute(op, R_{i,j}) \not\Rightarrow Affects(R_{k,l}), \quad \forall (k,l) \neq (i,j)
⸻
3. DSM Bilateral State Model
A. Decentralized Consistency
• Global DSM consistency is the conjunction of all pairwise relationships:
GlobalConsistency_{DSM} = \bigwedge_{i \neq j} Consistent(R_{i,j})
B. Hash-Linked Verification
• State integrity is enforced by cryptographic linkage:
Consistent(R_{i,j}) \iff \forall (S^i_m, S^j_p) \in R_{i,j}, \quad Hash(S^i_m) = S^j_p.
\text{prev\_hash}
⸻
4. CAP Theorem Does Not Apply
A. CAP Exemption via Bilateral Isolation
• In DSM, consistency, availability, and partition tolerance are all achieved
per relationship:
• Relational Consistency:
C
_{DSM}(S) \iff \forall i \neq j,\, Consistent(R_{i,j})
• Relational Availability:
A
_{DSM}(S) \iff \forall op \in O_{i,j},\, Response(op) \neq error
• Partition Tolerance:
P
_{DSM}(S) \iff Partition(i,j) \implies Offline(R_{i,j}) \land \forall (k,l) \neq (i,j),\,
Operational(R_{k,l})
• Conclusion:
C
_{DSM}(S) \land A_{DSM}(S) \land P_{DSM}(S) = \text{true}
DSM is not limited by CAP, because its model is not global.
B. Local Availability Without Quorums
• Availability is achieved per relationship:
Available(R_{i,j}) \iff \forall op \in O_{i,j},\, Process(op, R_{i,j}) = true
⸻
5. DSM Fault Domain Isolation & Trilemma Solution
A. Fault Isolation
• Faults are strictly contained:
IsolatedFault(R_{i,j}) \implies \forall (k,l) \neq (i,j),\, Fault(R_{i,j}) \not\Rightarrow
Affects(R_{k,l})
B. All Three Properties Per Relationship
• Each bilateral relationship can achieve all CAP properties:
\bigwedge_{i \neq j} \left(C(R_{i,j}) \land A(R_{i,j}) \land P(R_{i,j})\right)
C. New Distributed Boundaries
• Theorem:
A distributed system with bilateral isolation and cryptographic transitions can
simultaneously satisfy C, A, P for each relationship domain.
⸻
6. DSM in Practice: True Peer-to-Peer Model
• No miners, no validators, no global consensus
• Instant finality: State transitions are self-verifying
• Direct offline P2P transactions:
• Example flow:
1. Alice & Bob meet.
2. Alice pre-commits a transaction to Bob via Bluetooth.
3. Bob cryptographically verifies and finalizes instantly.
4. States synchronize to network when online—but validity
is local and instant.
• No liquidity/routing issues: Unlike Lightning, there are no channel/
routing dependencies.
• Offline = Digital Cash:
• DSM is the only model where offline digital cash is
mathematically possible, with no double-spend or counterfeit risk, and
without online dependency.
⸻

DSM operates outside CAP by localizing all security and availability.
Every relationship is an independent, cryptographically self-contained
system.

8–10. DSM: Cryptographic Trust, Verification, and Architecture — Concise
Reference
⸻
A. Internet Trust: Problems and DSM’s Guarantees
Centralized Trust Weaknesses
• Third parties (corporations, states) control identity & funds.
• Centralized databases are high-value attack targets.
• Censorship and arbitrary exclusion are possible.
• Blockchains use slow, energy-heavy consensus and don’t support true
offline p2p.
DSM Eliminates Centralized Trust
• No accounts, no passwords: Identity is embedded in deterministic
cryptographic state.
• No validators or miners: No consensus—transactions finalize instantly
on device.
• Offline operation: State transitions and verification can happen entirely
offline.
• Quantum resistance: Native use of post-quantum primitives (e.g.
SPHINCS+, Kyber, BLAKE3).
⸻
B. DSM Core Guarantees
• No Forks, No Double-Spend: State can only evolve forward, each state
links cryptographically to the last.
• Self-Sovereign Identity: No external accounts, all keys & states are
user-owned.
• Instant Finality: Once a new state is generated, it is final and self-
verifying.
• Offline + Online Security: State transitions and verifications work
offline, sync later with no double-spend risk.
• Post-Quantum Security: All primitives are quantum-safe.

D. Core Mechanism: Straight Hash Chain
State Linking
S
_{n+1}.\text{prev\_hash} = H(S_n)
Validation
\[
\text{Verify}(S_i, S_j) = \forall n \in [i+1, j]:\; S_n.\text{prev\hash} = H(S{n-1})
\]
S
_i \rightarrow S_j \iff \text{valid chain exists from } S_i \text{ to } S_j
Properties:
• Linear, forward-only.
• Tamper-proof: state order is encoded in the chain.
• Simple, no timestamp consensus needed.
⸻
E. Efficient Lookups: Sparse Index (SI)
• SI is a set of periodic checkpoints:
SI = \{ S_0, S_k, S_{2k}, …, S_{nk} \}
• To lookup S_
m:
• Find previous checkpoint S_{ik}, then traverse forward.
Trade-off:
• Larger k: less storage, slower lookup.
• Smaller k: faster lookup, more checkpoints.
⸻
F. Inclusion Proofs: Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT)
• The root:
SMT
_{\text{root}} = H\left(\{ H(S_0), H(S_1), …, H(S_n) \}\right)
• Membership proof for S
i:
_
\pi = \text{GenerateProof}(SMT, H(S_i))
\text{VerifyInclusion}(SMT_{\text{root}}, H(S_i), \pi) \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}
• Logarithmic time proof — don’t need the whole chain.
⸻
G. DSM’s Bilateral, Relationship-Based Storage
• Each entity E_
i has its own chain:
Chain
_{E_i} = [S^0_{E_i}, S^1_{E_i}, …, S^n_{E_i}]
• Any relationship (pair) E_i, E_j:
Rel
_{E_i,E_j} = \left\{ (S^{m_1}{E_i}, S^{p_1}{E_j}),\; (S^{m_2}{E_i}, S^{p_2}{E_j}),
… \right\}
• Bilateral isolation:
• All lookups and proofs are per-pair, not global.
• Each chain has its own SI and SMT.
• No global index.
⸻
H. Cross-Chain Verification and Continuity
• E
i verifies E
_
_j by requesting S^0_{E_j} (genesis) and walking the hash
chain + SMT proofs.
• E
_i only cares about Rel_{E_i,E_j} (their own history with E_j), not E_j’s
unrelated states.
⸻
I. Security and Properties
• Hash chain integrity:
Pr(\exists S_i \neq S_j: H(S_i) = H(S_j)) \leq \epsilon
(collision resistance: \epsilon is negligible)
• Fault isolation:
• Compromise in one relationship does not affect others.
• Temporal ordering:
• Order is cryptographically sequenced.
• Censorship resistance:
• Entities evolve privately, no intermediaries.
• Offline usability:
• Peer-to-peer finalization; network sync is a convenience, not a
requirement.
⸻

Absolutely—here’s a fully consolidated, concrete, production-ready DSM
account/contact creation and storage workflow, including all core
cryptographic details, MPC, DBRW, Genesis, and contact management. This
will be concise, but nothing crucial omitted—a true “core protocol reference” for
both backend and frontend devs.
⸻
DSM Identity & Contact Creation: End-to-End Concrete Workflow
1. Identity Generation (First Launch / Account Setup)
Step 1.1: Device Binding with DBRW
• Device runs DBRW (Dual-Binding Random Walk):
• Combines cryptographic hardware/environmental fingerprinting
with entropy.
• Output: Device-unique secret seed and public “Device ID”.
Step 1.2: MPC Genesis Creation (Optional for Extra Security)
• If enabled, the app can use Multi-Party Computation (MPC):
• Several parties/devices contribute randomness.
• All parties compute Genesis state deterministically (no party knows
the whole secret).
Step 1.3: Genesis State Construction
• Use seed (from DBRW/MPC) to generate:
• Genesis Hash (genesis_hash):
S
_0 = H(\text{DBRW\_seed} \,\|\, \text{MPC\_entropy?} \,\|\,
\text{device\_fingerprint})
• Device ID:
\text{DeviceID} = H(\text{DBRW\_public})
• Keypair (for post-quantum signatures):
• Generate with deterministic seed, e.g. SPHINCS+, Kyber,
Blake3, etc.
• Genesis is published to decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, DSM
storage node), and its hash becomes your public anchor.
Summary (What gets stored):
• Device ID, Genesis hash, public key, and local secret material (secure
enclave/keystore).
⸻
2. Adding a Contact (Counterparty)
Step 2.1: Initiation (Online Only, One-Time)
• You enter an alias (“Alice”, “Bob”, etc.).
• System fetches the counterparty’s Genesis (using provided info, e.g.
QR scan, or lookup).
Step 2.2: Genesis Verification
• System:
• Fetches Genesis Hash from decentralized storage.
• Validates Device ID (derived from Genesis/DBRW).
• Optionally verifies signature/MPC proof.
Step 2.3: Local Contact Entry Creation
type DsmContact = {
alias: string;
deviceId: string; // From their Genesis
genesisHash: string; // From decentralized storage
chainTip?: string; // Set after first tx
addedAt: number;
};
• Fields:
• alias = user input.
• deviceId = cryptographic, immutable.
• genesisHash = online-fetched, for authenticity.
• chainTip = set after you transact.
• addedAt = timestamp (optional, for bookkeeping).
• Storage:
• Frontend: Shows alias for selection.
• Backend/Bridge: Manages and verifies deviceId/genesisHash,
stores and updates chainTip.
Note:
• Contacts are mandatory—all transactions require at least one verified
counterparty with validated genesis.
• You cannot transact with someone who is not in your contact list.
⸻
3. Transaction Preparation & State Management
Step 3.1: Finding a Contact
• User selects contact by alias (frontend).
• System fetches contact by deviceId/genesisHash (backend).
• Looks up the current chainTip (last shared state index/hash).
Step 3.2: State Update and Bilateral Chain
• Transaction is created:
• References both parties’ latest state.
• Updates local state chain, increments chainTip.
Step 3.3: Storage After Transaction
• Updates:
• chainTip in your contact record (tracks the latest bilateral state).
• Each transaction is cryptographically linked to prior state:
S
_{n+1} = H(S_n \,\|\, \Delta_{n+1} \,\|\, \text{other fields})
• Validity is strictly enforced by hash chain logic and cryptographic
proof.
Step 3.4: Offline and Online Sync
• If transaction is done offline (e.g., via Bluetooth):
• Both parties update their local bilateral chain.
• When either party reconnects, syncs with the network.
• ChainTip ensures no state divergence; double-spends are
impossible.

Code Fragments/Reference Implementations
Add Contact (Pseudo-Backend):

const theirDeviceId = getDeviceIdFromGenesis(theirGenesisHash);
if (!verifyGenesis(theirGenesisHash, theirDeviceId)) throw Error("Invalid

contacts[theirDeviceId] = {
alias,
deviceId: theirDeviceId,
genesisHash: theirGenesisHash,
chainTip: undefined,
addedAt: Date.now()
};
}
After Transaction:
function updateChainTip(theirDeviceId: string, newChainTip: string) {
if (contacts[theirDeviceId]) {
contacts[theirDeviceId]×chainTip = newChainTip;
}
}
⸻
Key Security/Workflow Points
• No accounts/passwords: All identity is cryptographically bound.
• Genesis/DBRW required: Prevents impersonation.
• Contacts must be verified before first tx: All by Genesis from
decentralized storage.
• ChainTip keeps bilateral state atomic and in sync.
• Frontend only handles UI/alias, never secrets.
• Backend/Bridge enforces all cryptographic checks, state updates,
and proof verification.
⸻
⸻
DSM Identity Genesis: Precise Protocol Reference
Every DSM identity genesis is created by a real MPC (Multi-Party
Computation) protocol involving BOTH:
• The user’s client device (phone, etc.)
• A set of decentralized storage nodes (selected for the genesis event)
All parties contribute entropy and participate as equal MPC participants, and
all use DBRW (Dual-Binding Random Walk) to bind their share.
⸻
Step-by-Step Genesis Workflow
1. Genesis Initiation:
• Frontend: User presses “Create Identity.”
• Backend: Starts MPC protocol session, selecting (randomly or
deterministically) a set of DSM storage nodes as co-participants.
2. Entropy & DBRW Binding:
• Each storage node generates its entropy share, runs DBRW
over its hardware/env.
• Client device also generates an entropy share and runs DBRW
using its own device fingerprint/environment.
• All parties produce their MPC share as:
e
_i = DBRW(device_fingerprint_i, env_
state
_i, session_nonce)
• All shares are cryptographically mixed as part of the MPC.
3. MPC Execution:
• All parties (nodes + client) run the MPC protocol (e.g.,
quantum-safe threshold scheme or distributed keygen).
• The combined output produces the canonical genesis state:
S
_0 = H(MPC_
shares
_1..n || genesis_params)
• No single party—including the client—can bias or predict the
final result.
4. Publishing Genesis:
• The resulting genesis state and the cryptographic transcript
(MPC/DBRW proof) are published by the storage nodes to
decentralized storage.
• Genesis state hash becomes the canonical identity root.
5. Genesis Reference Returned:
• The client device receives its genesis state reference/hash,
which is now retrievable and verifiable by anyone via decentralized
storage.
⸻
Contact Setup and Storage (Non-Optional):
• To transact, users must add a counterparty as a contact while online,
which means:
1. Retrieve the contact’s genesis state from decentralized
storage.
2. Verify the MPC/DBRW proof (against storage node and
client device signatures).
3. Store the contact in the wallet by:
• alias (user-chosen or provided)
• device
_id (contact’s device, unique)
• genesis_hash (root from decentralized storage)
• chain
_tip (latest state if already transacted)
⸻
Storage Model for Contacts:
Each contact is stored as a structured entry:
{
"alias": "Alice",
"device
_id": "abc1234",
"genesis_hash": "H(S_0^Alice)",
"chain
_tip": "H(S_n^Alice)" // optional if not yet transacted
}
⸻
Summary Table for Code:
Phase Who Participates Key Mechanism Where Stored
Genesis Creation Client + Storage Nodes MPC + DBRW, Quantum-Safe Hash
Decentralized Storage
Contact Addition Client (Online) Genesis/MPC/DBRW Verification Local Wallet
DB
⸻
Bottom Line:
• Genesis creation always = (client + storage nodes) in MPC + DBRW.
• Contact setup is mandatory, and always validated from
decentralized storage.
• Contact entries are indexed by alias, device ID, genesis hash, and
chain tip.

DSM: Advanced Cryptographic Identity, State, and Commitment Protocols
⸻
1. Hierarchical Merkle Tree for Multi-Device Identity
1.1 Device Sub-Genesis Derivation
• Root Identity: User’s “master” genesis state is created via standard
MPC+DBRW with the client and storage nodes.
• For each device:
Sub-genesis is derived as:
S0
_deviceX = H(S0_master || device_
id
_X || device_entropy_X)
• No device ever creates an independent root—only sub-genesis from the
canonical master.
1.2 Merkle Tree Aggregation
• All device sub-genesis hashes aggregated into one master Merkle root:
MerkleRoot = Merkle(H(S0_device1), H(S0_device2), ...)
• Merkle proofs allow any device to prove it belongs to the identity root
without revealing others.
1.3 Device Chains and Cross-Device Auth
• Each device runs its own hash chain:
Chain
_deviceX = [S0_deviceX, S1_deviceX, ..., Sn_deviceX]
• Verifiers check:
1. Merkle proof: S0_
deviceX ∈ MerkleRoot (linked to master)
2. Valid chain from S0
deviceX → Sn
_
_deviceX (no gaps/rewrites)
1.4 Device Revocation/Recovery
• If a device is compromised/lost:
• Its sub-genesis is flagged/revoked in the Merkle root.
• New device: generate new sub-genesis, add to Merkle root.
• Other devices/chains remain valid and unaffected.
⸻
2. State Evolution and Key Rotation
2.1 Forward-Only Entropy and Ephemeral Keys
• Every state step:
en+1 = H(en || op_n+1 || n+1)
• en = previous entropy, op = operation, n = state index.
• Ephemeral Key for Each State:
(shared_n+1, encapsulated_n+1) = KyberEnc(pkr, en+1)
en+1' = H(shared_n+1)
• Keys are never reused; each state has a unique quantum-safe key.
2.2 Security
• Modifying any state requires a hash collision or key forgery (infeasible).
• Key compromise only affects one state; future states are secure due to
entropy/key evolution.
⸻
3. Pre-Signature Commitment and Fork Prevention
3.1 Mandatory Commitment Phase
• Before a state is finalized:
C
_pre = H( H(S_n) || op_n+1 || e_n+1 )
• Both parties (sender/recipient) co-sign C_pre before finalizing S_
n+1.
• S
_
n+1 cannot be produced by either side unless both have signed off.
3.2 Double-Spend/Fork Resistance
• Impossible to create two valid S
n+1 from one S
_
_n without forging the
other’s signature.
3.3 Offline Security
• Commitments exchanged over proximity (Bluetooth/NFC) allow for
offline double-spend prevention.
• When re-synced, both parties’ chains reflect the single, co-signed state.
3.4 Forward Commitments
• Future actions can be cryptographically referenced (“pre-committed”) in
the current state to allow programmable, multi-stage protocols without Turing-
complete code:
S
_n+1 includes H(future_params) for S_n+2, etc.
⸻
4. Transaction Modalities
4.1 Unilateral (Online) Transactions
• Only sender is active; transaction sent to decentralized directory/
storage.
at the time).
• Counterparty independently verifies on retrieval (no live co-sign required
4.2 Bilateral (Offline) Transactions
• Both devices are present; commitment phase and state attestation are
completed directly and synchronously (e.g., via Bluetooth).
• Both parties instantly verify, co-sign, and update their chains without
internet.

⸻
DSM Transaction Workflow Models: Implementation Reference
1. Unilateral (Online) Transaction
Operational Sequence
1. Genesis Verification
• Entity A (sender) retrieves Entity B’s genesis state (from
decentralized storage node).
• Verifies B’s genesis with Merkle/DBRW proof—must be done online at
contact creation.
2. State Construction
• A constructs a new state S
_{n+1}:
• Encodes transfer:
S
_{n+1} = {prev_hash: H(S_n), op: transfer_
to
_B, Δ: token
_amount, ...}
• Uses forward entropy/key evolution.
3. State Submission
• A publishes S_{n+1} to decentralized storage (DSM node/directory).
4. Finality
• For A: Transaction is final as soon as S
_{n+1} is published.
• For B: Upon reconnecting, retrieves S
_{n+1}, verifies the hash chain,
and updates their chain tip.
5. Responsive Actions
• B cannot send dependent transactions until synchronized with directory
and state chain is updated.
Code Responsibility
• Backend: Storage nodes validate, store, and serve genesis/state chain
proofs.
• Frontend:
• Requests genesis at contact add (one-time, online).
• Publishes new state.
• Triggers UI sync when state chain updates.
Pseudocode
// On contact add (frontend)
fn add
_contact(alias, genesis_hash, device_id) {
// Fetch & verify genesis from storage node
let genesis = fetch_
from
_storage(genesis_hash);
assert!(verify_genesis(genesis, device_id));
store
_contact(alias, device_id, genesis_hash, None); // No chain tip yet
}
// Send transaction (frontend)
fn send
_tokens(contact, amount) {
let state
_n = get_

2. Bilateral (Offline) Transaction
Operational Sequence
1. Precondition
• Both entities must be synchronized to the latest shared state for this
relationship.
• If pending online tx exist, must sync first!
2. Proximity Establishment
• Entities A & B connect locally (Bluetooth/NFC).
3. Commitment Phase
• A generates pre-commitment hash:
C
_pre = H(H(S_m) || op || Δ || e_{m+1})
• Both A and B co-sign C_pre (mutual attestation).
4. State Finalization
• Both A and B generate and store new state:
S
_{m+1} = {prev_hash: H(S_m), op, Δ, ...}
• Both update their local chain tip for this contact.
5. Deferred Synchronization
• Upon next online connection, both publish their updated chain tip/state
to directory.
• The global system synchronizes when available, but offline state is
immediately final and mutually agreed.
Data Storage
• Each contact in wallet: {alias, device_id, genesis_hash, last_
chain
_tip}
• Both hash chains updated locally after each bilateral tx.
Security Guarantees
• Double-Spend Impossible: Both sides must sign.
• Non-Repudiation: Mutual signatures serve as proof of participation and
state observation.
• Synchronization Constraint:
• If you missed online updates with this contact, must sync first!
• Can transact offline with other contacts regardless.

3. Example: Offline Asset Swap (AR Game)
Protocol Sequence:
1. Initiator creates exchange offer:
let exchangeParams = "E1:" + assetA×id + ",E2:" + assetB.id + "," + exchangeId;
let nextEntropy = calcNextEntropy(state.entropy, exchangeParams, state.stateNum
+ 1);
let hashCommitment = hash(hash(state) + exchangeParams + nextEntropy);
let sig = sign(state.privateKey, hashCommitment);
// Send to peer via Bluetooth
2. Recipient verifies and co-signs:
let expectedParams = ...; // Construct as above
let expectedEntropy = ...; // As above
let expectedHash = hash(hash(state) + expectedParams + expectedEntropy);
if (offer.exchangeHash !== expectedHash) reject();
let coSig = sign(state.privateKey, expectedHash);
// Return coSig to initiator
3. Both finalize state:
let newStateE1 = createNewState(e1State, exchangeHash, exchangeParams);
let newStateE2 = createNewState(e2State, exchangeHash, exchangeParams);
// Both store and sign their new states
4. Deferred sync to global directory on reconnection.

Every transaction is provably unique, double-spend-immune, and
independently verifiable.
The architecture dynamically defaults to the strictest model possible based on
connectivity, always guaranteeing mathematical safety and cryptographic
auditability.
Here’s a concise, production-grade, non-redundant reference for the next set
of core DSM protocol mechanics, with equations and critical concepts explicitly
preserved for AI code assistance and protocol implementers.

18. Token Management and Atomic State Transitions
Atomicity
• Every token operation is inseparable from a state transition:
$$ B
_{n+1} = B_n + \Delta_{n+1}, \quad B_{n+1} \geq 0 $$
• $\Delta_{n+1}$: Balance change at this state (positive for recipient,
negative for sender).
• Non-negativity ensures no overdrafts.
State Structure (token transfer):
S
_{n+1} = (e'_{n+1}, \text{encapsulated}_{n+1}, T_{n+1}, B_{n+1}, H(S_n),
op_{n+1})
• Any tampering with B_{n+1} or related fields breaks the hash chain and
fails verification.
Token Conservation/Auditability:
• All token movements sum to zero across the protocol (no inflation, no
leakage):
$$ \sum \Delta_{\text{all}} = 0 $$
⸻
19. Paradigmatic Transition: Eliminating the Account Model
• No external user accounts, usernames, or passwords.
• Identity is a cryptographic, forward-only chain—the only “ownership”
is control over your private key and deterministic state.
• Balances, credentials, and logic are part of your self-contained chain—
no databases, no rollback, no custodial authority.
• Proof of access = Proof of valid state transition.
• No rollback or freezes—immutability enforced by math.
⸻
20. Recovery and Invalidation Mechanisms
Snapshot Recovery:
• Store an encrypted snapshot of a safe state:
$$ M(S_n) = E(\text{key}_{\text{recovery}}, S_n) $$
• E: quantum-resistant symmetric encryption.
• key derived from user material.
Invalidation Marker:
• If compromised, publish:
$$ I(S_k) = (k, H(S_k), e_k, \sigma_I, m) $$
• $\sigma_I$: Signature from the recovery key.
• All states after $S_k$ are invalid.
Recovery Re-entry:
• New seed after compromise:
$$ e
_{new} = H(e_k | “RECOVERY” | \text{timestamp}) $$
• Clean bifurcation—compromised branch pruned, pre-compromise
remains valid.
⸻
21. Efficient Hash Chain Traversal
Sparse Index:
• Fast lookups via checkpoints:
$$ SI = {S_0, S_k, S_{2k}, \ldots, S_{nk}} $$
• k: Interval parameter.
• Verification Complexity:
$$ O(\log n) $$
• Efficient even for large chains or on resource-limited devices.
⸻
22. Quantum-Resistant Hash Chain Verification
• Key material and genesis entropy:
$$ \text{derivedEntropy} = H(\text{user secret} | \text{device id} | \text{mpc
contrib} | \text{app id} | \text{device salt}) $$
• Keypair generation:
$$ (\text{pk}\text{Kyber}, \text{sk}\text{Kyber}, \text{pk}\text{SPHINCS}, \text{sk}
\text{SPHINCS}) = \text{DeriveKeypairs}(\text{derivedEntropy}) $$
$$ \text{genesis hash} = H(\text{pk}\text{Kyber} | \text{pk}\text{SPHINCS}) $$
• Security: All state transitions are only forgeable if the underlying post-
quantum primitives are broken.
⸻
23. Quantum-Resistant Decentralized Storage Architecture
Requirements:
• Quantum resistance: All protocol cryptography is post-quantum.
• Information-theoretic privacy: State data is always encrypted; storage
nodes cannot read or forge.
• Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Deterministic replication for data
redundancy and censorship-resistance.
• Computational Efficiency: Designed for real-time, low-latency
operation, suitable for mobile and IoT.

updates their tip.
5. Responsive Actions

27. Deterministic Limbo Vault (DLV): Trustless, Deterministic Asset
Encumbrance
Core Idea:
• DLV = a vault whose private key cannot be derived or used until strict
cryptographic conditions are met, with all logic deterministic and verifiable.
• No external signatures, oracles, or ZK-proofs needed; only hash chain
and condition-attestation via DSM states.
⸻
27.1 DLV Definition & Lifecycle
DLV is the tuple:
$$
V = (L, C, H)
$$
• $L$: Lock condition function, $L:\Omega \to {0,1}$
• $C$: Set of condition parameters ${c_1, …, c_n}$
• $H$: Collision-resistant hash (BLAKE3)
Commitment:
$$
C
_{\text{initial}} = H(L \parallel C)
$$
• Registered to decentralized storage as "vault_
id": C
_{\text{initial}}
Lifecycle:
1. Vault Creation: Publish $C
_{\text{initial}}$ (commitment, lock
params) to storage.
2. Asset Encumbrance: Transfer to vault address—no private key
exists yet.
3. Condition Fulfillment: When $L(C)$ satisfied, reference state(s)
as proof $\sigma$.
4. Key Derivation:
$$
sk
_V = H(L \parallel C \parallel \sigma)
$$
Assets released; only possible after fulfillment.
VaultPost Schema Example (JSON):

"vault
_id": "H(L || C)",

"timestamp_created": 1745623490,
"status": "unresolved",
"metadata": {
"purpose": "loan settlement",
"timeout": 1745723490
}
}
⸻
27.2 Resolution/Verification Reference
• Resolution: Only possible with both commitment and attestation/proof
from DSM state.
• Pseudocode:
fn resolve
_vault(local_state: &State, incoming_state: &State, vault_hash: &Hash)
-> bool {
let expected = hash(local_state.hash() + incoming_
state.commitment +
incoming_state.something);
if expected != *vault
_hash { return false; }
if !check
lock
_
_condition(local_state, incoming_state) { return false; }
if incoming_state.prev_
hash != local
_state.hash() { return false; }
true // Vault resolved
}
• Unlocking key derivation only possible after:
• Hash chain verifies
• Lock condition met
Security:
• $sk
_
V$ cannot be derived before $\sigma$ (the proof) is known:
$$
\Pr[\text{Derive}(sk_V) \mid \neg\text{Has}(\sigma)] \leq \epsilon(\lambda)
$$
(negligible for security parameter $\lambda$)
• Quantum resistant: All hash, signature, and key operations are post-
quantum (BLAKE3, SPHINCS+, Kyber).
⸻
27.3 DLV Design Guarantees
• No pre-computable key: Private key does not exist until lock condition
is met and proof produced.
• No trusted party: No ZK, oracle, or external attestation required.
• Offline compatible: All operations are deterministic, storage-backed,
and cacheable.
• Full auditability: Vault creation, condition, and unlock all leave
cryptographic traces.
⸻
28. DSM Economic & Verification Model
28.1 Subscription-Based Economics
• No gas: No per-transaction fees.
• Users pay for storage used (periodic subscription; e.g. per GB, per
chain length).
• Token creation fee: One-time DSM token fee to prevent spam.
• Resource distribution:
$$
R
_{total} = R_{storage} + R_{treasury} + R_{ecosystem}
$$
• $R
_{storage}$: Storage node operators
• $R
_{treasury}$: Protocol maintenance
• $R
_{ecosystem}$: Onboarding, dev support
28.2 Cryptographic-Only Verification
• All validation = deterministic hash chain + signature checks.
• No economic incentive needed to reject fraud:
$$
V(H, S_n, S_{n+1}, \sigma_C) \to {true, false}
$$
• $H$: Hash function
• $\sigma_
C$: Signatures from required entities
• Selective Disclosure:
• Only minimum necessary data exposed, rest remains
encrypted.
28.3 Security Model
• All critical state transitions require:
• Hash chain integrity
• Deterministic entropy progression
• Balance conservation
• Monotonic state number
• Signature checks
• Pre-commitment inclusion
• Non-Turing complete:
• All state transitions are statically analyzable, finite,
deterministic, and guaranteed to terminate.
⸻
29. Bilateral Control Attack & Defenses
• Attack: If one party controls both ends of a transaction, can produce
two conflicting but valid-appearing states.
• Mitigations:
• Threshold Genesis: t-of-n MPC at genesis, making Sybil
attacks hard.
• Directory Consistency: Detects conflicts on sync.
• Bilateral Isolation: External parties can cross-verify histories.
• Network effect: As number of honest relationships increases,
attack becomes infeasible.
• Formally:
$$
P(\text{double spend}) \leq \min{
P(\text{genesis threshold control}),
P(\text{network partition}),
P(\text{verification isolation})
}
$$
• All approach zero as network grows, threshold increases.
• Mathematical invariants enforce security even under adversarial
control:
• Hash continuity, deterministic entropy, balance, monotonic
state, signature, pre-commitments.

30. Dual-Mode State Evolution: Bilateral & Unilateral Paradigms
30.1 Operational Modalities
Bilateral Mode (Disconnected/Peer-to-Peer)
• Synchronous co-signature: Both parties must mutually sign the new
state.
• Formalization:
$$
\text{BilateralTransition}(S_n, op_{n+1}) = {S_{n+1} \mid V(S_n, S_{n+1}, \sigma_A,
\sigma_B) = \text{true}}
$$
• Security: Immediate, double-spend-impossible finality offline.
• Usage: Default for offline/proximity-based operations.
Unilateral Mode (Online/Directory-Mediated)
• Asynchronous state: Initiator acts alone; recipient’s identity is
directory-anchored and verified via decentralized storage.
• Formalization:
$$
\text{UnilateralTransition}(S_n, op_{n+1}, ID_B) = {S_{n+1} \mid V_{uni}(S_n,
S
_{n+1}, \sigma_A, Dverify(ID_B)) = \text{true}}
$$
• Security: Sender achieves finality instantly; recipient syncs and verifies
upon reconnection.
• Usage: Online-first, one-sided execution.
⸻
30.2 Seamless Modal Interoperability
Transparent State Consistency
• Projection function:
$$
\text{StateProjection}: (S^A_n, ID_B) \to S^{A \to B}_{n+1}
$$
• Each state links to recipient’s directory identity, creating an “inbox” for
sync.
Recipient Sync Protocol
• Algorithm:
procedure RecipientSync(ID_B)
PendingTx ← QueryDecentralizedStorage(ID_B)
for tx in PendingTx:
S
_
last ← GetLastState(ID_B, tx.sender)
S
_
new ← tx.projectedState
if VerifyStateTransition(S_last, S_new, tx.signature):
ApplyStateTransition(S_last, S_new)
else:
RejectTransaction(tx)
• All incoming states are cryptographically validated before
acceptance.
Forward Commitment Guarantee
• Invariant:
$$
\forall S_n, S_{n+1} \in S: \quad Parameters(S_{n+1}) \subseteq C_{future}(S_n)
$$
• Effect: No unilateral tx can violate prior bilateral commitments—chain
continuity is always enforced.
Synchronization Precedence Theorem
• Constraint: After a unilateral tx, no new bilateral tx with that party until
the recipient has synced online:
$$
\text{PhysicalTransaction}(A, B) \implies \exists S^B_{k+1}: (S^A_{m+1},
S^B
_{k+1}) \in Rel_{A,B}
$$
• Guarantee: Prevents double-spending and state divergence.
⸻
30.5 Implementation Notes
• Automatic Mode Detection:
• Protocol detects peer presence/connectivity, auto-switches to bilateral if
possible (security first).
• Indexed Directory:
• Storage nodes must index “inboxes” for every identity. Lookup: $O(\log
n)$.
• Quantum Safety:
• All projections, signatures, directory proofs must use post-quantum
primitives.
• Enforcement:
• All state transitions (online/offline) rigorously enforce forward
commitments and hash chain continuity.
⸻
31. Implementation Considerations
31.1 Cryptographic Foundations
• Primitive suite:
• BLAKE3: Hashing (state chains, SMTs, DLVs)
• SPHINCS+: Stateless digital signatures
• Kyber: Key encapsulation (session/entropy evolution)
• Multi-source entropy:

\text{seed} = H(\text{user secret} | \text{device id} | \text{mpc contrib} | \text{app
id} | \text{device salt})
$$
• Ensures MPC-blind, device-blind key genesis.
• Resource-constrained optimization:
• All primitives must run efficiently on IoT/mobiles (no external HSM
required).
• Temporal consistency:
• All time-dependent logic (timeouts, expiries) is strictly hashed—no wall
clock trust required.

32. Storage Node Regulation: Cryptographically-Bound Identity
32.1 Identity Construction
• DeviceID:
$$
\text{DeviceID} = H(\text{user secret} | \text{external device id} | \text{mpc
contribution} | \text{app id} | \text{device salt})
$$
• Genesis hash:
$$
\text{genesis hash} = H(\text{pk}{\text{Kyber}} | \text{pk}{\text{SPHINCS}})
$$
• Properties:
• Unforgeable: Collision/negligible unless all entropy sources controlled.
• Verifiable: Any party can check if state = correct derivation from seed.
32.2 Bilateral Synchronization/Verification
• Pairwise sample:
• Each node checks random sample of states with peers, to ensure $\geq
\alpha_{threshold}$ consistency.
• Detection is exponential in omitted states (Hoeffding bound).
32.3 Information-Theoretic Opacity
• Node sees only hashes:
$$
$$
I(\text{Content}(S_n); \text{Representation}(S_n, node_j)) = 0
• Any censorship = random drop; cannot target by content.
32.4 Cryptographic Exclusion
• On verification failure, propagate signed invalidation marker for
DeviceID.
• Penalty:
• Cost = identity stake + lost revenue during exclusion, grows with
network value.
32.5 Bounded, Deterministic Verification
• Complexity:
$$
\text{Time: } O(\log |States| \cdot \beta)
$$
$$
\text{Space: } O(|N|)
$$
• No undecidability—every state is either valid or rejected.
32.6 Security Model
• Sybil resistance: MPC + cost.
• Selective state attack: Detection probability approaches 1 as more
states omitted.
• Manipulation attack: Only possible by hash collision.
32.7 Nash Equilibrium Penalty
• Compliance > violation for all rational actors as detection/penalty
scales with network value.
32.8/32.10 Optimization
• O(1) DeviceID lookup (probabilistic filter)
• O(1) genesis verification
• All hashing uses BLAKE3, hardware-accelerated if possible
• Checkpoint interval, SMT depth, etc., are device-tunable for
performance
